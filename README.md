# Branching 
This excercise explains branching.

## Creating branches
If the repo is created locally on git using ```git init```
* No branches will exist until a commit is done.

After committing, use ```git branch``` to view branches
* the current branch is indicated using an \* asterisk
To create a new branche use the ```git branch [name of the branch]```
To switch between branches use the ```git checkout [name of the branch]```
